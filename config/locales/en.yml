  info_filter_syntax: |
    SYNTAX: space between filter are interpreted as AND operator.
    Search is case insensitive.

    Values can contain spaces until the next key.
    Valid keys are : category, epic, status, title, tracker.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    title:my title                                                    category:my category
    tracker:bug                                                                   epic:an epic
    status:to do
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The title: key is not mandatory but, if it not specified, value should be placed as the first parameter.
  info_edit_point: If you let the field blank, the point will be destroy.
  info_work_complete: |
    This is calculated based on the story points.
    This is reflected by the last status defined (in Configuration menu), by default it's "Done".
    For example, if you have 50 story points in a sprint and you have 3 stories with 10 story points that have been the "Done" status (by default) , the 'Work complete' will be 20% (i.e. 10 out of 50 story points).
  info_time_elapsed: The time elapsed since the sprint was started. A percentage if sprint has an end date, else the number of days elapsed.
  info_tasks_progress: This is calculated based on done progression ratio of tasks attached to user stories.
  info_tasks: This field count all tasks attached to stories.
  info_scope_change: |
    Adding or removing a story from a sprint, after it has started is considered a change of scope. The percentage is calculated based on the story points.

    For example, if you started a sprint it 50 story points and add an issue with 5 story points, the Sprint Health would show a 10% scope change.

    If you add/remove stories that don't have estimates, the scope change will not be altered.
